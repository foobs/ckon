{"name":"ckon","tagline":"automatic compiler & linker for ROOT analyses","body":"Please find the docs at https://ckon.readthedocs.org\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n*ckon* is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care of compilation,\r\ndictionary generation and linking of programs and libraries developed for data\r\nanalyses within the [CERN ROOT analysis framework](http://root.cern.ch). This\r\nincludes parsing include headers to figure out which libraries the main\r\nprograms need to be linked to. It uses\r\n[automake/autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) to be platform\r\nindependent and GNU install compliant. In addition, [m4\r\nmacros](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/The-Macros.html#The-Macros)\r\nare automatically downloaded and the according compiler flags included based on\r\na list of [boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries provided in the config file.\r\nFor the purpose of YAML database usage, a m4 macro can be downloaded during\r\nsetup to link against the [yaml-cpp](https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/)\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n*ckon* is published under MIT License (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  \r\n\r\nPatrick Huck (@tschaume)  \r\n*invaluable contributions*: Hiroshi Masui\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
